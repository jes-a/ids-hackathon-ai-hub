# Code Style
- Always shorten and simplify
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- No over-engineering or premature abstractions
- Avoid unnecessary comments - code should be self-documenting

# Tech Stack
- Use Carbon Design System components, avoid custom UI
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Keep TypeScript types minimal - prefer inference
- Use SASS for styling, following Carbon patterns

# Avoid
- Creating new files unless absolutely necessary
- Adding error handling for impossible cases
- Feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims
- Excessive type annotations when inference works
